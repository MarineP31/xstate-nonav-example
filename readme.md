# XState-NoNav Example App

This is a sample app demonstrating a way of orchestrating the xstate Library with react-nonav.

You can find out more on [https://joyto.dev/xstate-nonav/](https://joyto.dev/xstate-nonav/)

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Have [expo](https://expo.io/learn) installed

**To run it:**

```
git clone git@github.com:yleflour/xstate-nonav-example.git
cd xstate-nonav-example
yarn
yarn start
```

## Notes

- This example is based on the [react-nonav example](https://github.com/tpucci/react-nonav/tree/master/example), transformed to run with xstate instead of mobx
- This example does not claim to be a definitive way of architecturing your app but it's a first step in how to integrate both libraries
